## Contributing code the right way 

*or: how I learned to post merge requests without crying myself to sleep*

1. Post your idea on the forums. Preferably post diffs if you got them. Mention your gitlab username.
2. If your idea was accepted, request developer permissions for the project via Gitlab.
2. When you have developer privileges you can make branches, check them out, work on them locally, push them back and post merge requests.
3. Usual stuff applies: don't post unrelated issues in one merge request, try to not screw up indenting (tt-rss mostly uses tab characters), try to respect surrounding formatting style, etc.
4. That's it.
